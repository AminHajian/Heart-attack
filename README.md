## Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the possibility of a heart attack based on parameters such as blood pressure and age. The <b>classification</b> models implemented in this project include:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of several features, including blood pressure,cholesterol and Fasting Blood Sugar along with the target variable indicating whether a heart attack occurred or not. you can easily find publicly available heart attack datasets online or in machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the results, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
